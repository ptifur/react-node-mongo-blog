# React Node MongoDB blog

## In case previous server did not stop

`killall -9 node`

### Open from terminal

```heroku open -a your-app```

## Further inquiry

Do you need `key={index}` for mapping in Blog.js

```
Warning: Each child in a list should have a unique "key" prop.

Check the render method of `Blog`. See https://fb.me/react-warning-keys for more information.
```

## Notes to myself

- Can't figures out how to redirect after submitting the form
- Not sure what exactly `axios` does

```yep! looks absolutely pants```

## Next

- Register / auth
- Update database users
- Set `id` as a `key`
- Do you need `.then response` after `fetch()`

## Next next

2. `Delete` button style
